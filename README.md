my Role:
As the developer of Elcenter, I played a pivotal role in designing and implementing the platform. I was responsible for the full-stack development, combining Firebase and Node.js to create a secure and efficient database system. I also integrated Vimeo for hosting video content and implemented the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

One of the key challenges was integrating Vimeo as the video server while maintaining data security and ensuring efficient video delivery. Additionally, creating a user-friendly interface that caters to the needs of both teachers and students was a significant undertaking. However, by leveraging Firebase, Node.js, and my web development skills, I successfully overcame these challenges to create a robust eLearning platform.
